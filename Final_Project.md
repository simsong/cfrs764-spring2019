# Final Project
Your final project builds upon Lab #4. In this project, which you may do individually or in a group, you will perform and report on original research in the area of Macintosh Forensics. 

For work, you should identify a specific aspect of the Macintosh operating system or a Macintosh application that you can meaningfully analyze within the aloted time period. You may research this topic in the classroom lab or at home. You will prepare a presentation and a written report on the work that you did. 

Your presentation and written report should include the following items:

1. What you are investigating.
2. Why it is important.
3. Prior work done on this topic, either other people hwo have researched the area on the Mac, or analogs on other platforms.
4. Your original contribution. Ideally, your contribution will include creating one or more datasets and analyzing those datasets. A "dataset" might be as simple as a logfile or as complex as a dis image.
5. Future work. You won't have enough time to finish the job, so write about what you accomplished, and obvious next steps.


Depending on the number of students in your group, you will have between 15 and 30 minutes to give your presentation. 

Proposed final project topics should be submitted the first week of April for approval. Questions should be submitted on the discussion board and will be answered there; answers will be incorproated into this description.
