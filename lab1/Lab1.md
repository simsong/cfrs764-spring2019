# CFRS 764 Lab 1

In this lab we will be working with the Macbook disk image from the DC Gallery Case. We will be analyzing it from the command line, but you can also use BlackLight if you wish. (Note: we will not cover the use of BlackLight in Lab 1.)

# Background

Our main goals of this project are:

1. Mount the disk image `tracy-home-2012-07-16-final` from [https://digitalcorpora.org/](https://digitalcorpora.org/) as a read-only file system on your Mac so that you can access it using the standard Unix command-line tools `grep`, `wc`, `head`, `tail` and so on.
2. Examine the files with the file browser, the command line utilities, or emacs. 
3. View the content of some files.


## Downloading and mounting the disk image

You will need the following disk image for this assignment:

* [tracy-home-2012-07-16-final.E01](http://downloads.digitalcorpora.org/corpora/scenarios/2012-ngdc/tracy-home/tracy-home-2012-07-16-final.E01)
* [tracy-home-2012-07-16-final.E02](http://downloads.digitalcorpora.org/corpora/scenarios/2012-ngdc/tracy-home/tracy-home-2012-07-16-final.E02)

Please download the disk image in advance of class. We will be mounting the disk image. There are several ways that you can do this:

1. You can convert the disk image to a raw (e.g. dd) file and then mount it read-only. You can convert the disk image with a program such as [FTK Imager](https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-4.2.0) which runs on Windows. Alternatively, you can convert it using [ewfexport](https://github.com/libyal/libewf), which can be easily installed on MacOS using [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Your instructor uses MacPorts. The converted file should be given a `.dmg` or a `.iso` extension so that it can be directly mounted using the Macintosh `hdiutil` tool, as described below.

2. You can use ewfmount (part of libewf) to "mount" the .E01 file and make a virtual raw file appear. You can then mount the virtual raw file using `hdiutil`. 

3. You can use **EW Mounter** (part of Blacklight) to mount the disk image. Documentation for EW Mounter appears in Appendix 2 (pp. 286-296) of the [2018 BlackLight User Guide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DPEpXdlfgUaTjRrb3i5N4VwLMS9NyLdY).

Note that in my experiments with ewfmounter on macOS 10.14.2, the mounted disk image can only be accessed by the superuser.

Here is a shell command that will export the E01 disk image to a raw file:

```
$ ewfexport -f raw -j4 -t tracy-home-2012-07-16-final -u tracy-home-2012-07-16-final.E0?
ewfexport 20171104


Export started at: Jan 13, 2019 13:28:57
This could take a while.

Status: at 7.2%
        exported 1.2 GiB (1358528512 bytes) of total 17 GiB (18639421440 bytes)
        completion in 50 second(s) with 329 MiB/s (345174471 bytes/second)


...
```

If you have created a raw disk image, you can mount it on a Mac at the location `/Volumes/tracy` using this command line:

```
$ hdiutil attach -readonly -owners on -noverify -mountpoint /Volumes/tracy tracy-home-2012-07-16-final.dmg 
/dev/disk2          	                               	/Volumes/tracy
```

If you want to try using ewfmount, below you will find a sequence that worked on your instructor's MacMini. Notice that the `hdiutil` command needs to be run as the superuser, since only the superuser has access to disk images mounted with `ewfmount`:

```
$ sudo ewfmount -X volicon=/Library/Filesystems/osxfuse.fs/Contents/Resources/Volume.icns tracy-home-2012-07-16-final.E0? /mnt
ewfmount 20171104

$ sudo ls -l /mnt/
total 18202560
-r--r--r--  1 root  wheel  18639421440 Jan 13 14:03 ewf1
$ ln -s /mnt/ewf1 /tmp/ewf1.dmg
$ sudo hdiutil attach -readonly -owners on -noverify -mountpoint /Volumes/tracy /tmp/ewf1.dmg
```

## Verifying the Mounted Disk

Once you have the file system mounted, however you have it mounted, verify that it's mounted and that you can access the following files. Note that I have it mounted at /Volumes/tracy.

$ ls -l /Volumes/tracy/var/

```

As you can see, I needed to access `/var/audit` as root, since it is mode 600. If you wish, you can mount a second copy where you own all of the files, but there may still be files that you are unable to read, by changing `-owners on` to `-owners off`. However, this will make it appear that you own all of the files! So you might want to mount a second copy of the file system at `/Volumes/tracy2`. Alternatively, you can just type `sudo bash` to bring up a root shell.

## Commands we will be using

Now that you have the disk image mounted (and possibly mounted twice!)

For answering these problems, you are free to use any command line tool that you wish. The following may be especially useful. To get details on any, type `man <command>` at the command line.

* `man` --- get documentation on a command.
* `grep` --- search for lines in a file that match a given regular expression.
* `head` --- Return the first N lines of a file
* `tail` --- Return the last N lines of a file
* `awk` --- Run a program in the AWK language. 
* `cut` --- Select portions of each line of a file
* `sort` --- Sort the lines of a file
* `uniq` --- Suppress repreating lines, optionally counting the number of suppressions.
* `wc` --- Report the number of characters, words, and lines in a file
* `cat` --- Combine files.

If you haven't done so, I recommend reading the man page for each of these.

Additional command that I find useful:

* `sed` --- Stream editor.
* `emacs` --- Programmer's editor, useful for looking at any file up to ~500MB in size. Can display hexdumps, too. (You can get a tutorial by typing `C-h T`)
* `xxd` --- Another way to generate a hexdump
* `file` --- Identify a file by its magic number(s).
* `ls` --- List files

The following `grep` options may be especially useful for this problem set:

* `grep -r <pattern> <directory>` --- Recrusive grep from _directory_ for _pattern_.
* `grep -l <pattern> ...` --- Just print the names of files with matching content.

So, you might do this:

* `grep -r ‘Jan 10’  /Volumes/tracy/private/var/log` --- Search for every log file that contains `Jan 10` on a line; print that line

When you list files with the `ls`, the times are displayed in local time using the TZ environment variable. If you want to use Eastern time, this his:

    ```
    export TZ=America/New_York
    ```

* `ls -lT` --- will show full timestamps
* `ls -alT` ---  will show files beginning with dots
* `ls -alFT` --- will also show a / after directories
